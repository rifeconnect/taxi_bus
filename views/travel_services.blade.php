    <p>This is the travel services page. This service was put in place in order to ensure security and comfortability for you as a road user.</p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>When you <a href="/booking/create">book a trip</a>, the system approves your booking and then you proceed to make payment. After this, you'd be added to a trip and our vehicle will come and pick you up at your specified location with others on the same trip on the intended day and drop you off at your exact destination so you don't have to wait long hours for the bus to get enough passenger nor do you have to worry about getting a taxi from the park to your house because we will drop you off at your exact destination and everything has been sorted out for you online. Won't you rather take a trip with us?</p>
