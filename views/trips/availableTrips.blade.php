	<p>This page should display all the available trip so that you can conveniently choose to hop into`any trip of your choice. If it is not displaying any trips yet, it means we are still working on it and would have it functional when it is done. Please bear with us. You may proceed to <a href="/booking/create">book a trip.</a></p>
